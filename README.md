# GraphicsEngine
A 16 bit windows console 3D graphics engine and framework written in C#.

This is a learning project regarding creating the foundations of a 3D graphics engine.

Code varies from personal work to various github open source projects all put together to create a nice API for the framework.

Credits to the various open source projects where I found the basis of creating this to come soon.
