# GraphicsEngine
A 16 bit windows console 3D graphics engine and framework written in C#.

This is a learning project regarding creating the foundations of a 3D graphics engine.

Currently 3D objects are rendered onto 2D space with scaling and translation transformations implemented.

TODO- add camera and rest of transformations (rotations), and much much more.
